**Build Pico applications with LED panels, easy WiFi, and composable device abstractions.**

`device-envoy` provides device-level abstractions for embedded Rust, built on the Embassy async framework. It focuses on reusable, typed async APIs that hide timing, interrupts, channels, and shared state inside each device.

Rather than replacing HALs or drivers, `device-envoy` builds on them, modeling devices as long-lived async tasks with clear, high-level APIs.

Currently targeting Raspberry Pi Pico 1 and Pico 2 (ARM cores). RISC-V core support exists but is not actively tested.

## Status

⚠️ **Alpha / Experimental**

The API is actively evolving. Not recommended for production use, but excellent for experimentation, learning, and exploratory projects.

## Features

- **[LED Strips](https://docs.rs/device-envoy/latest/device_envoy/led_strip/) & [Panels](https://docs.rs/device-envoy/latest/device_envoy/led2d/)**  - NeoPixel-style (WS2812) LED arrays with 2D text rendering, animation, embedded-graphics support. Provides efficient options for power limiting and color correction.
- **[WiFi (Pico W)](https://docs.rs/device-envoy/latest/device_envoy/wifi_auto/)** - Connect to the Internet with automatic credentials management. On boot, opens a web form if WiFi credentials aren't saved, then connects seamlessly to stored networks. Requires Pico W; WiFi is not supported on non-W boards.
- **[Button Input](https://docs.rs/device-envoy/latest/device_envoy/button/)** - Button handling with debouncing
- **[Servo Control](https://docs.rs/device-envoy/latest/device_envoy/servo/)** - Servo positioning and animation
- **[Flash Storage](https://docs.rs/device-envoy/latest/device_envoy/flash_array/)** - Type-safe, on-board persist storage
- **[LCD Display](https://docs.rs/device-envoy/latest/device_envoy/char_lcd/)** - Text display (HD44780)
- **[IR Remote](https://docs.rs/device-envoy/latest/device_envoy/ir/)** - Remote control decoder (NEC protocol)
- **[RFID Reader](https://docs.rs/device-envoy/latest/device_envoy/rfid/)** - Card detection and reading (MFRC522)
- **[Clock Sync](https://docs.rs/device-envoy/latest/device_envoy/clock_sync/)** - Network time synchronization utilities
- **[LED4 Display](https://docs.rs/device-envoy/latest/device_envoy/led4/)** - 4-digit, 7-segment LED display control with optional animation and blinking
- **[Single LED](https://docs.rs/device-envoy/latest/device_envoy/led/)** - Single digital LED control with animation support

## Forum

- **[Using Embassy to build applications](https://github.com/CarlKCarlK/device-envoy/discussions)**  
  A place to talk about writing embedded applications with Embassy—sharing code, asking practical questions, and learning what works in practice.  
  Not limited to Pico boards or to `device-envoy`.

## Examples & Demos

The project includes **examples** (single-device tests) in `examples/` and **demo applications** in `demos/` showing integration patterns:

### Example: animated LED strip

This example cycles a 96-LED strip through red, green, and blue frames.
![Animated 96-LED strip example (APNG)](docs/assets/led_strip_animated.png)

It shows how device-envoy generates a device struct for an LED strip and animates a sequence of frames.

```rust,no_run
# #![no_std]
# #![no_main]
# use panic_probe as _;
# use core::convert::Infallible;
use device_envoy::{Result, led_strip::{Frame1d, colors}};
use device_envoy::led_strip;

led_strip! {
    LedStripAnimated {
        pin: PIN_4,
        len: 96,
    }
}

async fn example(spawner: embassy_executor::Spawner) -> Result<Infallible> {
    let p = embassy_rp::init(Default::default());
    let led_strip_animated = LedStripAnimated::new(p.PIN_4, p.PIO0, p.DMA_CH0, spawner)?;

    // Create a sequence of frames and durations and then animate them (looping, until replaced).
    let frame_duration = embassy_time::Duration::from_millis(300);
    led_strip_animated.animate([
        (Frame1d::filled(colors::RED), frame_duration),
        (Frame1d::filled(colors::GREEN), frame_duration),
        (Frame1d::filled(colors::BLUE), frame_duration),
    ])?;

    core::future::pending().await // run forever
}
```

See the `examples/` and `demos/` directories for complete runnable code.

## Building & Running

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Add Rust targets for Pico boards
rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi           # Pico 1 (ARM)
rustup target add thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf    # Pico 2 (ARM)
```

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run examples using convenient aliases
cargo blinky                # Simple LED blinky (Pico 1)
cargo blinky-2              # Simple LED blinky (Pico 2)

cargo clock-lcd-w           # LCD clock with WiFi (Pico 1 WiFi)
cargo clock-lcd-2w          # LCD clock with WiFi (Pico 2 WiFi)

cargo clock-led12x4-w       # LED panel clock (Pico 1 WiFi)
cargo clock-led12x4-2w      # LED panel clock (Pico 2 WiFi)

# Check without running (faster builds)
cargo blinky-check          # Compile only
cargo clock-lcd-w-check     # Check Pico 1 WiFi version

# Build and check everything
cargo check-all
```

**Tools:**

- `just` - Optional command runner (install with `cargo install just` or your package manager). See `justfile` for commands.
- `xtask` - Project's custom automation tool (built-in, use via `cargo xtask --help`)

See `.cargo/config.toml` for all cargo aliases.

## Hardware Notes

### Standard Pinouts

Examples use conventional pin assignments for consistency:

- **PIN_0**: LED strip (8-pixel simple example)
- **PIN_1**: Single LED (blinky patterns) - Built-in LEDs are modeled as active-high (OnLevel::High) on all supported boards
- **PIN_3**: LED panel (12×4, 48 pixels)
- **PIN_4**: Extended LED panel (12×8, 96 pixels)
- **PIN_5**: Long LED strip (160 pixels, broadway/marquee effects)
- **PIN_6**: Large LED panel (16×16, 256 pixels)
- **PIN_13**: Button (active-low)
- **PIN_11, PIN_12**: Servo signals

## Testing

Host-side tests run on your development machine without hardware:

```bash
just check-all
```

`just` is the optional command runner (install with `cargo install just` or your package manager). See **Tools** above.

Tests include:

- LED text rendering comparisons against reference images
- 2D LED matrix mapping algebra
- LED color space conversions
