**Build Pico applications with LED panels, easy WiFi, and composable device abstractions.**

`device-envoy-rp` is a library for building embedded applications in Rust, built on the Embassy framework. It organizes hardware around *device abstractions*.

A device abstraction is a software encapsulation of hardware that manages timing, tasks, control flow, interrupts, channels, and state within the abstraction.

Rather than replacing HALs or drivers, `device-envoy-rp` builds on them. It defines device abstractions that expose a small set of simple operations to the rest of the program.

`device-envoy-rp` supports the Raspberry Pi Pico and Pico 2 (ARM cores). RISC-V core support on the Pico 2 is not currently included. Its sibling package, [`device-envoy-esp`](https://docs.rs/device-envoy-esp), supports all ESP32 families currently supported by [esp-hal](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal).

**Feedback**: If you try this crate, I’d love to hear how it goes, whether it works well, fails to build, needs clearer docs, or does not fit your hardware. Please send feedback to carlk AT msn.com.

## Features

- **[CYD Display & Touch](https://docs.rs/device-envoy-rp/latest/device_envoy_rp/cyd/)** - Drive standalone 320×240 ILI9341/XPT2046 display and touch modules from Pico 1 or Pico 2, with calibration, orientation, memory-efficient tiled rendering, and one- or two-SPI wiring. See the [implementation overview](https://docs.rs/device-envoy-core/latest/device_envoy_core/cyd/#implementations-1) for all CYD implementations, including interactive browser simulation and native desktop testing.
- **[LED Strips](https://docs.rs/device-envoy-rp/latest/device_envoy_rp/led_strip/) & [Panels](https://docs.rs/device-envoy-rp/latest/device_envoy_rp/led2d/)**  - NeoPixel-style (WS2812) LED arrays with 2D text rendering, animation, embedded-graphics support. Provides efficient options for power limiting and color correction.
- **[WiFi (Pico W)](https://docs.rs/device-envoy-rp/latest/device_envoy_rp/wifi_auto/)** - Connect to the Internet with automatic credentials management. On boot, opens a web form if WiFi credentials aren't saved, then connects seamlessly to a stored network. Requires Pico W; WiFi is not supported on non-W boards.

- **[RFID Reader](https://docs.rs/device-envoy-rp/latest/device_envoy_rp/rfid/)** - Card detection and reading (MFRC522)
- **[Clock Sync](https://docs.rs/device-envoy-rp/latest/device_envoy_rp/clock_sync/)** - Network time synchronization utilities
- **[LED4 Display](https://docs.rs/device-envoy-rp/latest/device_envoy_rp/led4/)** - 4-digit, 7-segment LED display control with optional animation and blinking
- **[Single LED](https://docs.rs/device-envoy-rp/latest/device_envoy_rp/led/)** - Single LED control with animation support

## Thanks

Special thanks to [Brad Gibson](https://github.com/U007D/), organizer of the [Seattle Rust User Group](https://www.meetup.com/seattle-rust-meetup/). He introduced me to Rust programming on microcontrollers, suggested the term *device abstraction*, and encouraged thinking in terms of shared traits across controller families. Those conversations helped set the goals for device-envoy.

## Examples & Demos

The reusable platform crate is accompanied by **examples** (single-device tests) in [`device-envoy-examples-rp`](../device-envoy-examples-rp/examples/) and **demo applications** in `demos/` showing integration patterns:

### Example: animated LED strip

This example cycles a 96-LED strip through red, green, and blue frames.

![Animated 96-LED strip example (APNG)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CarlKCarlK/device-envoy/main/crates/device-envoy-rp/docs/assets/led_strip_animated.png)

It shows how device-envoy generates a struct (device abstraction) for an LED strip and then animates a sequence of frames.

```rust,no_run
# #![no_std]
# #![no_main]
# use panic_probe as _;
# use core::convert::Infallible;
use device_envoy_rp::{Result, led_strip::{LedStrip as _, Frame1d, colors}};
use device_envoy_rp::led_strip;

led_strip! {
    LedStripAnimated {
        pin: PIN_4,
        len: 96,
    }
}

async fn example(spawner: embassy_executor::Spawner) -> Result<Infallible> {
    let p = embassy_rp::init(Default::default());
    let led_strip_animated = LedStripAnimated::new(p.PIN_4, p.PIO0, p.DMA_CH0, spawner)?;

    // Create a sequence of frames and durations and then animate them (looping, until replaced).
    let frame_duration = embassy_time::Duration::from_millis(300);
    led_strip_animated.animate([
        (Frame1d::filled(colors::RED), frame_duration),
        (Frame1d::filled(colors::GREEN), frame_duration),
        (Frame1d::filled(colors::BLUE), frame_duration),
    ]);

    core::future::pending().await // run forever
}
```
