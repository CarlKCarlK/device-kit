//! Device abstractions for peripherals for Pico 1 and 2 (with and without WiFi).
//!
//! # Glossary
//!
//! Resources available on the Pico 1 and Pico 2:
//!
//! - **PIO ([Programmable I/O](https://medium.com/data-science/nine-pico-pio-wats-with-rust-part-1-9d062067dc25)):** Pico 1 has 2. Pico 2 has 3.
//! - **DMA ([Direct Memory Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access)):** Both Pico 1 and 2 have 12 channels.
//! - **PWM ([Pulse Width Modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation)) Slices:** Both  Pico 1 and 2 have 8 slices (& 16 channels). These "slices"
//!   are unrelated Rust slices.
