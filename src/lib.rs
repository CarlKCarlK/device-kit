//! Device abstractions for peripherals for Pico 1 and 2 (with and without WiFi).

//! cmk000 too conspicuous?
//! # Hardware Glossary
//!
//! ## PIO (Programmable I/O)
//!
//! Specialized hardware blocks that can implement custom digital protocols.
//! Used for timing-sensitive operations like driving WS2812 LED strips.
//!
//! - **Pico 1 (RP2040):** 2 PIO blocks (PIO0, PIO1)
//! - **Pico 2 (RP2350):** 3 PIO blocks (PIO0, PIO1, PIO2)
//!
//! Each PIO has 4 state machines, allowing multiple independent protocols to run simultaneously.
//! Many modules (LED strips, servos) compete for PIO resources, so plan your hardware allocation carefully.
//!
//! See the [RP2040 Datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf)
//! for detailed information.
//!
//! ## DMA (Direct Memory Access)
//!
//! A hardware controller that transfers data between memory and peripherals without CPU involvement.
//! Enables efficient LED animation, audio playback, and other data-intensive operations.
//!
//! - **Pico 1 & 2:** 12 DMA channels (DMA_CH0 through DMA_CH11)
//!
//! Each device abstraction that uses DMA claims one channel, so availability depends on how many
//! concurrent operations you need.
